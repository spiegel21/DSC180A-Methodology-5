# About Me

I am a undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego, working under the mentorship of Dr. Yusu Wang and Dr. Gal Mishne in Section A16.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a particular emphasis on:

- **Graph Transformers**: Exploring how transformer architectures can be adapted for graph-structured data, leveraging attention mechanisms and positional encoding techniques.
- **Neural Collapse**: Investigating this fascinating phenomenon in the context of GNNs, specifically examining how the within-class variability of features collapses to their class means during training.
- **Model Benchmarking**: Evaluating and reproducing results of state-of-the-art GNN models to ensure reproducibility and understand architectural improvements.

## Current Projects

I am currently investigating several interesting directions in deep learning:

1. **Neural Collapse in Graph Transformers**: Extending existing studies of neural collapse from Graph Convolutional Networks to Graph Transformers.

2. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**: Exploring methods to enhance the training efficiency and performance of graph neural networks.

3. **Contrastive Learning**: Investigating representation learning techniques for graph-structured data that reduce dependence on labeled data.
